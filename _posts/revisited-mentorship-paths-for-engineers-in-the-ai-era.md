> “Most of us aren't lost — we just need new maps.”

The past year has pushed engineers into a strange duality: half-excited by the power of LLMs, half-anxious about what’s left to own. I've mentored engineers going through this exact shift — some thriving, others frozen. And it’s clear:

We need **new pathways**.
Not based on titles. Not based on seniority.
But on **how you want to grow alongside AI**.

So I revisited my original mentorship framework and updated it for this new landscape as it seems there is no turning back to the normative / regular way of practicing software engineering.

This isn’t a ladder. It’s a **loop model** — learn, simulate, reflect, reposition. Choose the orbit that fits your context.

![A diagram showing three AI-era growth paths for engineers: AI-Augmented Builder, Systems-Oriented Curator, and Impact-Driven Explorer](/assets/blog/revisited-mentorship-paths-for-engineers-in-the-ai-era/ai-path.png)

### 🧠 1. The AI-Augmented Builder

**For those who love moving fast and building the future with tools in motion.**

**You’ll spend time with:**

- 🧠 Prompt Engineering, Function Calling (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- ⚙️ LangChain, LlamaIndex, WebLLM
- 🖥️ In-browser agents, multi-modal experiences (voice, vision, code)
- 🚀 Deno, Hono, Next.js, local-first AI apps, in-browser AI.

Of course, this will include the guidance on choosing the best of both worlds for your next side hussle under my target-to-the-goal planning and navigating.

**Your loop:**
`Prototype → Simulate → Refactor → Share → Repeat`

### 🔍 2. The Systems-Oriented Curator

**For those who find beauty in evaluation, architecture, and trust.**

You care how AI systems behave in the real world. You debug not just the output — but the **alignment**, **latency**, and **failure states**.

**Core Idea:** Become a steward of AI systems — where *safety, observability*, and *evaluation* are your north stars.

**You’ll go deep on:**

- 🛠️ LLM evaluation tools: Trulens, Ragas, Giskard
- 🔍 Observability stacks: Langfuse, PromptLayer, OpenTelemetry for AI
- 🧪 Synthetic testing, simulation frameworks, persona agents
- 🧱 Infra-first systems: ScyllaDB, NATS JetStream, WASM modules in Elixir/Go or maybe OCaml w/ MetaProgramming (why not sci-fi, right?)

**Your loop:**
`Observe → Instrument → Evaluate → Improve → Scale`

---

### 🎯 3. The Impact-Driven Explorer

**For those who want to build for people, not just for infrastructure.**

You see AI as a tool for shaping education, journalism, governance, and art. You want to bring your full mind — not just your stack — into your work.

**Core Idea:** Reframe engineering as *applied thinking across domains* — with AI as a lens, not the spotlight.

**You’ll explore:**
- 🧭 Human-AI collaboration: explainability, inclusive design, narrative UI
- 🧩 Agentic systems: CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph
- 📚 Domain-specific RAG: policy, health, civic tech, accessibility
- 🗺️ Storytelling + analytics: Observable, DuckDB, Streamlit, HuggingFace Spaces

**Your loop:**
`Immerse → Reframe → Co-create → Share → Lead`

---

You’re not locked in. You can orbit all three paths depending on your phase, team, or purpose.

But when you feel stuck, ask:

- Do I want to **build faster**? → *AI-Augmented Builder*
- Do I want to **stabilize what others build**? → *Systems-Oriented Curator*
- Do I want to **build where it matters most**? → *Impact-Driven Explorer*

Each one is valid. Each one demands **loop-based growth**, not linear progress.

I’ll be sharing deeper notes, templates, and examples for each path.
If you’re designing your next move — or mentoring others — this model is yours to remix.

Stay looped in.
