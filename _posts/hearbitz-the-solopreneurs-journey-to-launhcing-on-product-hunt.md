When it comes to launching a new product, the day of the week can often make all the difference. While many swear by the power of "Product Hunt Tuesday," we decided to go against the grain and embark on our journey with a Wednesday launch at 09:00 CET. Why, you might ask? Well, **[Hearbitz](https://www.hearbitz.com)**, a project I've been passionately developing as a solopreneur for the past few months, deserved to be seen by as many eyes as possible from all corners of the world. 🌍

Here's how it all unfolded:

**1. Timing is Everything ⏰**

The decision to launch on a Wednesday at 09:00 CET was a strategic one. We aimed to showcase Hearbitz across different timezones, especially Pacific Standard Time (PST), ensuring that a global audience would have the opportunity to interact with our product and provide valuable feedback. As a solopreneur, I've poured my heart and soul into this project, and I wanted to gather insights from the audience as soon as possible. 🌎

**2. Leveraging the Website & Coming Soon Page on Product Hunt 🌐**

To maximize our reach, we integrated the Product Hunt upvote button directly on the Hearbitz website. This allowed users who regularly visited the app through our main page to be informed about the launch and show their support directly. It was a small addition that made a big impact. I cannot underestimate the help from Product Hunt via suggestions made in the popover menu on the left of our product page. Additionally, I've launched a Coming Soon page for showcasing on the Coming Soon list before going for launch.

**3. Amplifying on LinkedIn 📢**

Immediately after the launch, we took to LinkedIn to make the announcement. We shared the news both on the Hearbitz LinkedIn account and my personal account, ensuring that our professional network was aware of the milestone we had achieved. 📚

**4. Taking to Twitter (well, _X_ I must say) 🐦**

Twitter is a platform known for its real-time engagement, so we wasted no time in tweeting about the launch from the Hearbitz Twitter account. We also shared the news from my personal Twitter account, broadening our reach and connecting with the vibrant Twitter community. 🐤

**5. A Surprise Twist 🎉**

As the day progressed and a new day started in the PST timezone, we decided to add an extra layer of visibility to our launch. We quoted a surprise post from an account that curates AI products. This move had a twofold effect - it showcased Hearbitz to a wider audience and demonstrated our commitment to the AI community.

**6. Building Momentum 📈**

In the initial hours, the upvotes were slow to accumulate, but slowly and surely, Hearbitz started gaining traction. As of now, we're thrilled to have **87** upvotes and **23** comments while placing on **#20nd** (recently #23nd-ish). The response from the Product Hunt community has been incredible, filled with valuable feedback that will help us shape the future of Hearbitz. 📊

In conclusion, our unconventional Wednesday launch at 09:00 CET turned out to be a brilliant decision. It allowed us to engage with a diverse global audience, garner support from various timezones, and receive insightful feedback. The journey of building Hearbitz has only just begun, and we're excited to continue improving and growing with your support.
