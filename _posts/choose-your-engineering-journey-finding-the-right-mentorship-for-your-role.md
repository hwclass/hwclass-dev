Before weeks ago, I’ve firstly announced the mentorship programme I’ve decided to take individuals into a structured career path into, to help them navigate in a huge tech ocean to let them choose what’s best for their very own career.

And it included 3 paths like **Career Path**, **Contributor Path** & **Master Path**. All of those were carefully crafted patterns to be followed based on what’s expected to get at the end: Either you would like to put your career going on into the right presence with CV reviewing, prep interviews, insights and guiding with valuable insights on being more apparent in front of recruiters and interviewers, or you would like to learn by building things which may disrupt the current app ecosystem on my guidence with code reviews support, architectural decisions taken together with fully-hands-on effort by oneself, or you may expect to have a full care on your career from both perspectives: career and coding.

You can also check the article I’ve published about the first initiative I’ve taken here: **[Mentoring over Coaching: Art of Mentoring "Bored" Techies](https://hwclass.dev/posts/mentoring-over-coaching-art-of-mentoring-bored-techies)** & here about what I have organised for making your career better: **[Empowering Engineers: Navigating Excellence Through Mentorship](https://hwclass.dev/posts/empowering-engineers-navigating-excellence-through-mentorship)**.

So now after a couple of months with mentoring experience, I am happy to share that I’ve partitioned the paths into more focused set of guidance patterns by the role you have (maybe my future potential mentee, who knows 😊) and curated the whole set of paths with an additional one for you.

So are you ready to take your engineering career to the next level? Whether you're just starting out, aiming for the stars, steering a team, or leading from the executive helm, my mentorship program has tailored paths to suit your specific role and aspirations.
