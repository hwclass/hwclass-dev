As you remember, I have introduced the paths for my mentorship services a while ago with a chain of 2 (two) blog posts you can find more details about within below links. They're basically for mostly seasoned engineers / coders / programmers for letting them going into the depths of their growth labyrinth and improve more. They're basically for people who are already in the industry for a while and I am stil helping all of my mantees from a holistic point of view by providing not only skills to grasp, also the industry experience to let them aware what's really going on...

But after a careful consideration and a certain demand around myself, I've noticed that such a path would be something beneficial for everyone I can help for. So here is the new path I am introducing.

Are you a newcomer to the exciting world of software engineering? Or perhaps you're embarking on a career change, transitioning from another industry to join the tech-savvy community? I understand that the early stages of this journey can be both exhilarating, daunting and a bit overkill. That's why, I'm thrilled to introduce the _Foundation Builder Path_ â€“ a unique and comprehensive starting point designed for helping you establish a solid foundational groundwork in software engineering, hone your skills for your growth, and set the stage for your future success.
