**Embarking on a Journey: Building Hearbitz with the Power of Google Cloud Platform and Cutting-Edge Technologies**

In the ever-evolving landscape of news consumption, it's more crucial than ever to stay informed. As the creator of Hearbitz, an innovative news app that harnesses AI-powered summaries in multiple languages, I embarked on a transformative journey to redefine how we connect with the world's stories.

Hearbitz's architecture has evolved, incorporating Google Cloud Platform (GCP) alongside groundbreaking technologies like OpenAI, and a robust CMS, HyGraph. This journey has brought Hearbitz to life, reimagining the way we experience news.

Now, let's take a deeper dive into the architecture and innovations that have breathed life into Hearbitz, including new additions to the tech stack: GCP Cloud Tasks and Cloud Run, enhancing the reliability and robustness of our content retrieval system.

**Crafting the Magic: How Hearbitz (was/is) Working**

Before, we were totally relying on the "scraper" cloud function for hitting to the each news source and gather the content to be passed out as text to be summarised. But we've noticed some certain hickups as some of the functions were throwing errors because of the timeouts during the remote fetching due to the unfortunate depencencies onto the news sources.

This will make us think the whole structure again and decided to move to an another direction for gathering the data from the news sources: Instead of running a serverless function for more than 30 sources, we deployed an API with an endpoint `/scrape` to fetch the sources and send the payloads to `event-summarise-content` PubSub topic.

After switching from (finely-tuned) Cloud Function to Cloud Run endpoint, we are now able to catch all of the news resources content and reliably send them for summarising purposes to OpenAI's API.

![](/assets/blog/revolutionizing-news-delivery-building-hearbitz-with-google-cloud-platform-and-cutting-edge-technologies/crafting-the-magic-how-hearbitz-was-working.png)

Additional to the new choices applied to the architecture, the whole adventure starts with the "trigger-scrape-content-new" scheduler. The Scheduler plays a vital role in automating content retrieval for Hearbitz. Its precise timing capabilities trigger the process of scraping daily news content from various sources, ensuring users receive the latest and most relevant information in different languages. Recent language support we have is like the list here: "Turkish", "English", "German", "Dutch", "Catalan", "French", "Italian", "Hindi" and "Portuguese" (for Portugal & Brazil, too).

**PubSub Event: event-scrape-content**

The PubSub Event acts as a seamless communication bridge, facilitating the smooth flow of data within Hearbitz. Once the Scheduler triggers the content scraping process, the PubSub Event ensures that the next step within the flow (as the Cloud Run instance) within the app are notified and updated with the fresh data. This real-time event-driven approach enhances the responsiveness and efficiency of Hearbitz.

**Cloud Run API: /scraper**

The API running on Cloud Run, specifically located behind "/scraper," endpoint is the workhorse behind Hearbitz's content aggregation process. It intelligently collects and processes the scraped content referring to the metadata stored within our Firestore instance and organizes. This dynamic functionality ensures that Hearbitz's news snippets are accurate, up-to-date, and tailored to users' preferences.

**Cloud Tasks & the Task Doing the Job: scraper-task**

![](/assets/blog/revolutionizing-news-delivery-building-hearbitz-with-google-cloud-platform-and-cutting-edge-technologies/crafting-the-magic-how-hearbitz-is-working.png)

Once the `event-scrape-content` topic is triggered to ping the `/scraper` endpoint, a new task generated within the Cloud Tasks queue to be picked up and run with the logic inherently placed into the `scraper-task` Cloud Function(s). Each news source will be doubled with a cloud task and a scraper-task to be completed with 3 retry attempts as an answer to non-completed / failed tasks and the logging off for keeping the price less. The queue itself has 500 dispatches per second with a 1000 as maximum dispatch value.

**Bringing Summarization to Life: The Process Behind Hearbitz**

Now, let's explore the captivating process that brings concise and insightful summaries to Hearbitz users. Two key players make this magic happen: PubSub Event and the OpenAI API.

![](/assets/blog/revolutionizing-news-delivery-building-hearbitz-with-google-cloud-platform-and-cutting-edge-technologies/bringing-summarization-to-life-the-process-behind-hearbitz.png)

PubSub Event "event-summarize-content" receives freshly scraped news content from the "scraper" function. As data flows through Hearbitz, this event acts as a pivotal trigger, ensuring the summarization process begins in a timely and efficient manner.

**Cloud Function: summariser**

Meet the "summarizer"â€Š-â€Šthe heartbeat of Hearbitz's summarization engine. As the PubSub Event activates this Cloud Function, it swiftly fetches scraped content from Hearbitz's storage and connects with the OpenAI API. Additionally, we now specify the language for OpenAI API to generate, mapping the language codes from Google Text-to-Speech.

Default languages supported on Hearbitz, too as mentioned above. The OpenAI API masterfully analyzes the content sent by the summarizer, distilling the essence of each news piece with cutting-edge natural language processing capabilities. This dynamic trioâ€Š-â€ŠPubSub Event, `summarizer`, and the awe-inspiring OpenAI APIâ€Š-â€Šwork in perfect harmony to deliver the magic of concise and personalized news snippets right to your fingertips.

**Empowering Transformation: From Text to Audio**

At the heart of this transformation lies the PubSub Event "event-transform-content." This event plays a pivotal role in initiating the journey from written news to engaging audio. When triggered, it propels the process forward, ensuring that the next steps come to life.

**Cloud Function: transformer**

The "transformer"â€Š-â€Šthe genius behind converting written news into delightful audio. As the "event-transform-content" sets the wheels in motion, the transformer seamlessly steps in, leveraging the power of the Google Text-to-Speech API. The very challenge which forces me to use stream.PassThrough() to solve the issue of "not-so-big voice files" (with around 70-80 KB) in an asynchronous way.

![](/assets/blog/revolutionizing-news-delivery-building-hearbitz-with-google-cloud-platform-and-cutting-edge-technologies/empowering-transformation-from-text-to-audio.png)

Another challenge was the voice type of the news. Originally they are "NEUTRAL", "FEMALE" and "MALE" defined by Google Text-to-Speech API but for example in Turkish, there is only FEMALE supported by the API itself. Still investigating, hope that's just something like a coincidence.

**Cloud Storage: Home of Captivating MP3s**

As the transformer works its magic with the Google Text-to-Speech API, captivating MP3 files are born. These audio gems find their home within Cloud Storage, ready to be served to Hearbitz users, bringing the news to life through their headphones.

This incredible trioâ€Š-â€ŠPubSub Event, "transformer", and the Google Text-to-Speech APIâ€Š-â€Šshowcases the art of transforming written words into immersive audio experiences.
